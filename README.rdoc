Getting Started

You must first have a Blitline.com account to successfully use the gem. You can obtain one (free) by going to http://www.blitline.com

Once you have your account, you will need to find you ACCOUNT_ID which you can get by logging in and clicking on the *Account* tab.


In you application environment, install the Blitline gem or add the Blitline gem to your Gemfile

    $ gem install blitline

or...if you have a Gemfile

    gem 'blitline'

Once the gem is installed, you can start a Rails console and try the following:

    $ job = Blitline::Job.new("http://www.google.com/logos/2011/yokoyama11-hp.jpg") # My source file to manipulate
    $ job.application_id = "ACCOUNT_ID" # This ACCOUNT_ID needs to be your account ID from Blitline which you got from Blitline.com above
    $ blur_function = job.add_function("blur", {:radius => 1}) # Add a blur function
    $ blur_function.add_save("my_first_image") # Adds a save function (which takes a string parameter which is what the image is identified as on callback/polling)
    $ blitline_service = Blitline.new
    $ blitline_service.jobs << job # Push job into service
    $ blitline_service.post_jobs

And you will get JSON back describing where the resulting image will be located
There are many more things you can do with images (including pushing them to your own S3 buckets).
